                                            As a computer science master's
                                            student at UCSD, I spend a lot of
                                            time thinking about how we explore
                                            and discover new things, both in
                                            research and in life. This website
                                            is an extension of that exploration,
                                            a place where I share all the cool
                                            things I've worked on and talk about
                                            what interests me.

                                        I found myself in the produce aisle at

                                        dizzying array of apples in front of me.
                                        Gala, Honeycrisp, Granny Smith, and many
                                        others I've never even heard of. I'd

                                        tastes like, but the descriptions make
                                        it seem like just about every apple is
                                        somewhat sweet, somewhat tangy, and
                                        somewhat crisp. I couldn't ponder much
                                        longer because I still had ten other
                                        items to buy...

                                The abundance of choice may lead to better
                                dishes, but often leads to more confusion.

                                is therefore crucial to effective cooking. The
                                foundation of any great dish is the careful
                                thought and consideration that goes behind the
                                ingredients used in it.

                                prompted me to think more about this:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    This is a more general point that people may
                                    have made their minds up on already. People
                                    go to Japan to eat the absolute best quality
                                    of certain ingredients, accepting that
                                    they‚Äôre giving up on the diversity of
                                    produce and flavors from China and Taiwan.
                                    In that case, I‚Äôll make a stronger claim:
                                    except for sushi, every single dish in
                                    Japanese cuisine is done better by another
                                    Asian cuisine: jiaozi over gyoza, pakora
                                    over tempura, pho over ramen, mul naengmyeon
                                    over soba, hot pot over shabu shabu, Indian
                                    curries over Japanese, and Korean barbecue
                                    over yakiniku (except wagyu). When I
                                    workshopped this theory I heard a feeble
                                    defense raising okonomiyaki. I did have to
                                    think, but jianbing and b√°nh x√®o still win.
                                    Unless you plan on eating sushi every day (I
                                    would), choose Taiwan.

                                This struck a chord because I&#39;ve always felt
                                that Japanese food enjoys absurd levels of
                                popularity relative to other Asian cuisines.
                                While he overlooked dishes such as udon (chewy
                                noodles) and katsu (breaded meat cutlets), I
                                still agree with most of his critique. However,
                                the discussions I had with a few friends
                                revealed something I had overlooked: simplicity
                                can provide its own advantages.

                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                Japanese cuisine emphasizes maximizing the
                                quality and flavor from a select few ingredients
                                at the expense of variety. This could be
                                explained geographically: Japan is a mountainous
                                archipelago far removed from the equator where
                                most of the land is not suitable for agriculture
                                which means there really isn‚Äôt a lot of room for
                                growing a diverse array of vegetables or raising
                                livestock. This can lead to feelings monotony,
                                and even one of my friends who loves Japanese
                                food had to take breaks from it during his stay.
                                This is one of the main reasons why I was never
                                excited about Japanese food, but I also
                                under-appreciated the benefits of this
                                restriction.

                                    Yep that's just raw fish. And it's
                                    delicious.

                                Japanese cuisine&#39;s characteristic focus on
                                ingredient quality means that even basic dishes
                                are delicious. Nowhere is this more evident than
                                in Japan&#39;s convenience stores, which have
                                earned international acclaim. Instead of
                                dedicating extensive time to seeking out
                                high-end restaurants, travelers can confidently
                                grab meals to-go before heading off to explore.
                                Local citizens can also appreciate this
                                convenience because Japanese work culture is
                                known to be demanding, leaving people with
                                little energy to cook something when they get
                                back home.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This high baseline quality runs deeper than
                                convenience. By focusing on a few key
                                ingredients, Japanese chefs can achieve
                                extraordinary mastery. Critics and casual diners
                                alike can appreciate the requisite skill to
                                create raw seafood dishes such as sashimi.
                                There&#39;s no need to explain about the
                                technicalities of a bain-marie to impress them.
                                Watching a chef assemble sushi in front of you
                                adds a unique visual and experiential appeal.

                                Another advantage of simplicity means its easy
                                to add things on top to increase the variety.
                                Regional trade networks have led to Japan&#39;s
                                adaptation of spicy elements from its Asian
                                neighbors. Tantanmen, which incorporates the
                                same doubanjiang (chili bean paste) found in
                                Sichuan&#39;s mapo tofu, demonstrates how
                                Japanese cuisine can thoughtfully integrate
                                external influences while maintaining its
                                distinctive character. While traditional sushi
                                celebrates the pure flavor of fish, modern
                                interpretations incorporate various sauces that
                                add layers of complexity. Its much harder to do
                                this with a complex dish where there are already
                                so many different flavors competing for your
                                attention.

                                As an aside, none of this would be possible
                                unless the society as a whole strived to make
                                high quality ingredients accessible to everyone.
                                The same quality $5 sushi in the convenience
                                store would cost up to $20 in the US, which
                                helps explain my initial skepticism about
                                Japanese cuisine&#39;s reputation.
                                Unfortunately, this mark up reflects the broader
                                issue where a lack in quality is made up for
                                using additives like high fructose corn syrup.
                                Fresh meat and produce come at a steep price and
                                it&#39;s sometimes cheaper to eat mass produced
                                processed food instead. It&#39;s really no
                                wonder why

                                While Japanese cuisine demonstrates how
                                intentional ingredient selection can elevate
                                even simple dishes, recent trends in other
                                cuisines show what happens when this principle
                                is overlooked in favor of appealing to social
                                media.

                                There has been a recent trend of adding
                                mozzarella cheese to dishes like tteokbokki
                                (rice cakes), dakgalbi (spicy chicken), and even
                                traditional stews. While some combinations like
                                cheese + buldak (fire chicken) have become
                                popular, others feel much more forced.
                                Restaurants face intense competition and
                                understandably, some end up pandering to the
                                trend in a short sighted attempt to stay
                                relevant.

                                With thousands of cheese varieties available,
                                mozzarella is rarely the optimal choice. Yet,
                                its stretchy texture often wins out, catering to
                                visual appeal over nuanced flavor. One of my
                                friends who visited Korea recently describes his
                                grievances: a perfectly seasoned grilled chicken
                                has absolutely no need for such a bland
                                accompaniment that doesn&#39;t even stick
                                properly to the chicken anyway. Leave the cheese
                                pulls for dishes like pizza.

                                It&#39;s not just basic ingredients that get
                                mis-used, the thoughtless addition of luxury
                                ingredients like caviar and truffle is also a

                                , not because the addition creates a more
                                harmonious dish, but because its presence allows
                                the restaurant to double the menu price and
                                create an Instagram-worthy spectacle. This
                                treatment reduces these ingredients from their
                                role as refined flavor elements to the culinary

                                Then there&#39;s wagyu, the mere mention of
                                which brings people to salivation. When my
                                friend suggested Jeju Noodle Bar, a
                                Michelin-starred establishment serving wagyu
                                ramyun, I jumped at the chance. When the dish
                                finally arrived, I took a second to take it all
                                in. Here was a piping hot bowl of ramyun with
                                thin slices of wagyu draped neatly on the top.
                                The broth was undeniably delicious, but the
                                wagyu...it was almost lost. The fat, which I
                                expected to melt on my tongue like butter,
                                simply dissolved into the broth, leaving behind
                                strips of meat that, while tender, could have
                                been any decent cut of beef. There was no
                                distinct wagyu flavor, almost as if the broth
                                had swallowed it whole. At $45 a bowl, I
                                couldn&#39;t help but feel a twinge of
                                disappointment. In the future I hope to try a
                                dish that better showcases what makes wagyu so
                                special.

                                Not all premium-priced dishes reflect
                                thoughtless luxury additions. Though some would
                                argue that adding soup to dumplings is just
                                another gimmick to raise the price of the dish,
                                xiao long bao incorporates the ingredient much
                                more honestly and leads to a unique experience
                                that justifies the price bump.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Having attempted the creation of the dish
                                myself, incorporating the soup into the dumpling
                                is no easy feat. The flavor of the soup has to
                                be infused into a gelatinous binding and broken
                                up to evenly mix with the rest of the filling.
                                Folding the dough around this filling also takes
                                great care to prevent it from deforming while
                                steaming. Doing it once will humble you. Doing
                                it fifty times will leave you with immense
                                respect to the chefs who churn these out at
                                restaurant scale.

                                    I tried, but it looks more like Shumai than
                                    a soup dumpling, a testament to the skill
                                    required to make these.

                                Unlike the previous cases, the intention behind
                                adding soup inside a dumpling makes sense. The
                                soups liquid richness harmonizes well with the
                                rest of the filling as the meat becomes juicy
                                and tender. If anything, soup dumplings are the
                                opposite of gimmicks; they are a testament to
                                culinary technique. The careful construction
                                required to encase a flavorful broth within a
                                delicate wrapper is far from a simple trick.
                                While other related dishes such as baozi share
                                some similarities in their filling-to-wrapper
                                ratio, none quite replicate the experience of
                                biting into a soup dumpling.

                                If you&#39;ve made it this far, I hope you take
                                some time to reflect about various dishes
                                you&#39;ve tried and how the ingredients played
                                a role in your enjoyment of it. As a home cook,
                                I often enjoy combining various ingredients all
                                willy-nilly like some mad scientist. This
                                experience has shown me the value of intentional
                                ingredient selection, and I plan to apply that
                                more going forward.

                                As an aside, I was curious to see how Claude
                                could help me write this post without completely
                                losing my influence in it. My workflow was
                                repeatedly writing and asking for improvements.
                                It definitely sped up the time to achieve a
                                certain level of quality I was acceptable with
                                as the biggest issue I had was tying things
                                together in a way that flowed naturally. I also
                                think it helps with writers block since it is
                                able to quickly generate more supporting
                                examples or further areas of exploration. With
                                time, I&#39;m sure I could even feed it enough
                                writing samples to where it is able to write
                                things in my style.
