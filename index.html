                                            As a computer science master's
                                            student at UCSD, I spend a lot of
                                            time thinking about how we explore
                                            and discover new things, both in
                                            research and in life. This blog is
                                            an extension of that exploration, a
                                            place where I share my thoughts on
                                            everything from art and sports to
                                            history, philosophy, and of course,
                                            science.

                            <p>
                                As I was browsing ML twitter, I came across
                                Zhendong's 2024 year in review. Initially drawn
                                to the section about model evaluations, I found
                                myself fixated not on the evaluations but on a
                                bold claim about Japanese cuisine:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    This is a more general point that people may
                                    have made their minds up on already. People
                                    go to Japan to eat the absolute best quality
                                    of certain ingredients, accepting that
                                    they’re giving up on the diversity of
                                    produce and flavors from China and Taiwan.
                                    In that case, I’ll make a stronger claim:
                                    except for sushi, every single dish in
                                    Japanese cuisine is done better by another
                                    Asian cuisine: jiaozi over gyoza, pakora
                                    over tempura, pho over ramen, mul naengmyeon
                                    over soba, hot pot over shabu shabu, Indian
                                    curries over Japanese, and Korean barbecue
                                    over yakiniku (except wagyu). When I
                                    workshopped this theory I heard a feeble
                                    defense raising okonomiyaki. I did have to
                                    think, but jianbing and bánh xèo still win.
                                    Unless you plan on eating sushi every day (I
                                    would), choose Taiwan.
                                </p>

                            <p>
                                This struck a chord because I've always felt
                                that Japanese food enjoys absurd levels of
                                popularity relative to other Asian cuisines.
                                That said, I do think his opinion is overly
                                strong. He overlooked udon (chewy noodles) and
                                katsu (breaded meat cutlets) as both of these
                                don't really have an alternative in another
                                Asian cuisine. Also, claiming pho is
                                categorically better than ramen seems reductive
                                given the wide variation there is in both. I
                                consulted with a few friends about what they
                                made of Zhendong's stance left with a much
                                better understanding of the role of ingredient
                                usage in culinary philosophy.

                            <p>
                                To some extent, I agree with Zhendong's first
                                point: Japanese cuisine emphasizes maximizing
                                the quality and flavor from a select few
                                ingredients at the expense of variety. This
                                could be explained geographically: Japan is a
                                mountainous archipelago far removed from the
                                equator where most of the land is not suitable
                                for agriculture which means there really isn’t a
                                lot of room for growing a diverse array of
                                vegetables. From a traveler's perspective
                                though, there is most certainly enough diversity
                                to last through the short time you visit.

                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                Japanese cuisine's characteristic focus on
                                ingredient quality mean that even basic dishes
                                are delicious. Nowhere is this more evident than
                                in Japan's convenience stores, which have earned
                                international acclaim for their food quality.
                                Instead of dedicating extensive time to seeking
                                out high-end restaurants, travelers can
                                confidently grab meals to-go before heading off
                                to explore. Local citizens can also appreciate
                                this convenience because Japanese work culture
                                is known to be quite brutal and people may not
                                have the energy to cook something when they get
                                back home.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This high baseline quality runs deeper than
                                convenience. By focusing on a few key
                                ingredients, Japanese chefs can achieve
                                extraordinary mastery. Critics and casual diners
                                alike can appreciate the requisite skill to
                                create raw seafood dishes such as sashimi.
                                There's no need to explain about the
                                technicalities of a bain-marie to impress them.
                                Watching a chef assemble sushi in front of you
                                adds a unique visual and experiential appeal.
                                While it still isn't one of my favorite foods, I
                                can understand why so many people love it.

                                It would also be misleading to suggest that this
                                focus on a few ingredients results in a limited
                                palate. Regional trade networks have led to
                                Japan's adaptation of spicy elements from its
                                Asian neighbors. Tantanmen, which incorporates
                                the same doubanjiang (chili bean paste) found in
                                Sichuan's mapo tofu, demonstrates how Japanese
                                cuisine has thoughtfully integrated external
                                influences while maintaining its distinctive
                                character. I won't claim that these offshoots
                                are strictly better than their asian counter
                                parts, but they do offer a solution for those
                                who grow tired of the standard Japanese options.

                                Understanding the strengths of Japanese cuisine
                                prompted me to reflect on ingredient selection.
                                I previously mentioned the dubiousness of
                                comparing ramen to pho. While both are noodle
                                soups, this broad categorization obscures
                                significant differences. Ramen noodles,
                                typically made from wheat, are designed to be
                                firm and chewy (al dente), providing a
                                satisfying bite and holding up well in rich
                                broths. Pho noodles, made from rice flour, are
                                softer and more delicate, complementing the
                                lighter, more aromatic broth. This difference in
                                texture alone significantly alters the eating
                                experience. This difference is only exacerbated
                                when considering the broth and toppings as well.
                                Throughout the rest of this post, I explore a
                                few more examples of how the intention (or lack
                                thereof) behind ingredient selection makes or
                                breaks a dish.

                            <p>
                                There has been a recent trend of adding
                                mozzarella cheese to dishes like tteokbokki
                                (rice cakes), dakgalbi (spicy chicken), and even
                                traditional stews. While some combinations like
                                cheese + buldak (fire chicken) have become
                                popular, others are feel much more forced.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With thousands of cheese varieties available,
                                mozzarella is rarely the optimal choice. Yet,
                                its stretchy texture often wins out, catering to
                                visual appeal over nuanced flavor. One of my
                                friends who visited Korea recently describes his
                                grievances: a perfectly seasoned grilled chicken
                                has absolutely no need for such a bland
                                accompaniment that doesn't even stick properly
                                to the chicken anyway. In my opinion, you
                                shouldn't prioritize theatrical gimmicks over
                                substance: leave the cheese pulls for dishes
                                like pizza.

                                Wagyu. The mere mention of it brings people to
                                salivation. When my friend suggested Jeju Noodle

                                it all in. Here was a piping hot bowl of ramyun
                                with thin slices of wagyu draped neatly on the

                                wagyu...it was almost lost. The fat, which I
                                expected to melt on my tongue like butter,
                                simply dissolved into the broth, leaving behind
                                strips of meat that, while tender, could have
                                been any decent cut of beef. There was no
                                distinct wagyu flavor, almost as if the broth
                                had swallowed it whole. At $45 a bowl, I
                                couldn't help but feel a twinge of
                                disappointment. In the future I hope to try a
                                dish that better showcases what makes wagyu so
                                special.

                            <p>
                                Coming back to Taiwanese food, I wanted to bring
                                up a debate I had with some friends on whether
                                xiao long bao (soup dumplings) is another
                                example of a culinary gimmick or not. The main
                                point was that (at least in America), you pay a
                                heavy premium just for getting some soup in your
                                dumplings.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I rarely cook anything grander than the level of
                                a chipotle bowl, but xiao long bao was something
                                I've tried making before. Incorporating the
                                gelatinous soup into the filling isn't too bad,
                                though it does take some time to prepare. The
                                trickiest part is carefully folding the dough
                                and portioning the right amount such that it
                                didn't fall apart while cooking. Do it once and
                                you'll understand what I mean. Now do it 50 more
                                times. I have respect to people who can churn
                                these out at restaurant scale.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In this case I do think the added value is
                                reflected in the price mark up. The intention
                                behind adding soup inside a dumpling (as opposed
                                to something like wonton soup) makes sense. For
                                most people, meat should be juicy and flavorful.
                                The soups liquid richness harmonizes well with
                                the rest of the filling. If anything, soup
                                dumplings are the opposite of gimmicks; they are
                                a testament to culinary technique. The careful
                                construction required to encase a flavorful
                                broth within a delicate wrapper is far from a
                                simple trick. While other related dishes such as
                                baozi share some similarities in their
                                filling-to-wrapper ratio, none quite replicate
                                the experience of biting into a soup dumpling.

                                I hope reading this piece makes you take some
                                time to reflect about various dishes you've
                                tried and how the ingredients played a role in
                                your enjoyment of it. As a home cook, I often
                                enjoy combining various ingredients all
                                willy-nilly like some mad scientist. This
                                experience has shown me the value of intentional
                                ingredient selection, and I plan to apply that
                                more going forward.

                                As an aside, I was curious to see how Claude
                                could help me write this post. My biggest
                                complaint is that it often adds too much
                                sophistication or vividness, but maybe thats why
                                I'm not a writing major :P When prompted to tone
                                it down, it kind of over corrects and then
                                writes in a very cringe manner. Maybe in the
                                future I can just feed it old writing examples
                                and it will be more authentic.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My workflow was repeatedly writing and asking
                                Claude for improvements.I think this approach
                                helps deal with writers block and getting ideas
                                out faster while still retaining control over
                                the style.

                                Finally, I plan to keep writing on various
                                random topics so stay tuned for more 👀
